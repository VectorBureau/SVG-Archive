# SVG Archive
**by VectorBureau**

## About
*Welcome.*
This repository serves as an archive of reconstructed propaganda posters.
All designs have been digitally redrawn as vectors, with editable SVG files provided for public use.

I'm not a professional designer or historian,
but I hope this archive proves both interesting and useful.
